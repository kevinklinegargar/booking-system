**Guidelines**

 - Login using the fixed password "PasswordHardcoded532".
 - After a successful login the user will be redirected to the
   dashboard, But if there's no books yet, the user will be redirected
   to the book creation page.
 - Adding a new category just choose the "Other" category then a new
   field will appear. By default there are 4 categories.

**Enjoy :)**
